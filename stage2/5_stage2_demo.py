🛡️ STAGE 2: STEP 5 - COMPLETE AI TRAINING PIPELINE DEMONSTRATION

📋 EXECUTION FLOW (ML Training Pipeline):
1. 📊 1_dataset_prep.py prepares training data first
2. 🤖 2_training.py fine-tunes LLM on prepared data
3. 📈 3_evaluation.py validates model performance
4. ⚡ 4_inference.py provides production classification
5. 🚀 THIS FILE (5_stage2_demo.py) demonstrates the complete AI system

PURPOSE: Complete demonstration of Stage 2 AI training and inference pipeline.
SHOWS: Data prep → Training → Evaluation → Production inference workflow.
RUN WITH: python 5_stage2_demo.py (from stage2 directory)

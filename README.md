# üõ°Ô∏è **Algospeak-Aware Content Moderation System**
## *Production-Ready Two-Stage AI Pipeline for TrustLab*

---

## üìä **Executive Summary**

This project implements a **cutting-edge, two-stage AI content moderation system** specifically designed to detect and classify **"algospeak"** ‚Äî the coded or evasive language that users employ to circumvent traditional content filters.

**The Challenge:** Traditional keyword-based moderation systems catch only ~25% of harmful algospeak content, leaving platforms vulnerable to policy violations, user harm, and regulatory issues.

**Our Solution:** An intelligent two-stage pipeline that combines **fast pattern detection** with **context-aware AI classification**, targeting 75% algospeak coverage (3x improvement) while maintaining sub-100ms response times for real-time moderation.

## üß† **Architectural Deep Dive: Why Two Stages?**

### **ü§î The Fundamental Design Question**

During development, we extensively analyzed **two competing architectural approaches**:

#### **‚ùå Approach 1: Direct LLM Classification**
```
Input: "I want to unalive myself" 
   ‚Üì [Single LLM processes everything]
Output: "extremely_harmful, self_harm, severity: 3"
```

**Initial Appeal:**
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture (one model does everything)
- ‚úÖ End-to-end learning (model learns patterns + context)
- ‚úÖ Modern AI approach (pure neural solution)

**Critical Limitations Discovered:**
- ‚ùå **Scalability Crisis**: New algospeak requires complete model retraining
- ‚ùå **Cost Explosion**: Every slang update = $thousands in compute costs
- ‚ùå **Time Lag**: Weeks to retrain when new patterns emerge
- ‚ùå **Resource Waste**: 3B+ parameters learning simple pattern mappings

#### **‚úÖ Approach 2: Two-Stage Architecture (Our Choice)**
```
Input: "I want to unalive myself"
   ‚Üì Stage 1: Pattern Detection & Normalization (JSON-based)
"I want to kill myself" 
   ‚Üì Stage 2: Context-Aware AI Classification (LLM-based)
"extremely_harmful, self_harm, severity: 3"
```

**Strategic Advantages:**
- üîÑ **Instant Adaptability**: New algospeak ‚Üí Update JSON ‚Üí Immediate deployment
- üß† **Optimized Intelligence**: LLM focuses on context understanding, not pattern memorization
- ‚ö° **Performance Excellence**: Pattern matching (Œºs) + AI inference (ms) = <100ms total
- üîç **Explainable AI**: Know exactly which patterns triggered decisions
- üí∞ **Cost Efficiency**: No retraining needed for 90% of updates

### **üéØ Real-World Impact of This Decision**

**Scenario:** New algospeak emerges - "minecraft" becomes slang for "suicide"

| Approach | Response Time | Cost | Explanation |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------|
| **Direct LLM** | 2-4 weeks | $5,000+ | Collect data ‚Üí Retrain ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy |
| **Two-Stage** | 5 minutes | $0 | Add `"minecraft": "suicide"` to JSON |

This architectural choice makes our system **production-viable** for enterprise platforms processing millions of posts daily.

## üî¨ **Technical Deep Dive: Data Engineering**

### **üìä Dataset Preparation Journey**

Our training pipeline processes the **Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification** dataset (1.8M comments) using advanced data engineering techniques:

#### **Stage 1: Raw Data Analysis**
- **Source**: 1.8M human-annotated comments with toxicity scores
- **Processing**: Polars-based pipeline (10x faster than Pandas)
- **Quality**: Zero missing values in key columns, smart cleaning preserved harmful short content

#### **Stage 2: Toxicity Score Mapping**
```python
# Our intelligent categorization system
if target >= 0.8: label = "extremely_harmful"      # 1.7% of data
elif target >= 0.5: label = "harmful"              # 6.3% of data  
elif target >= 0.2: label = "potentially_harmful"  # 12.9% of data
else: label = "safe"                                # 79.1% of data
```

**Key Insight**: This 80/20 safe/harmful distribution **perfectly mirrors real-world content**, enabling the model to learn realistic decision boundaries.

#### **Stage 3: Algospeak Augmentation**
- **Base Samples**: 50,000 high-quality examples from Jigsaw
- **Algospeak Variants**: 2,913 additional samples created using Stage 1 patterns
- **Final Training Dataset**: 52,913 instruction-tuned samples (34MB)
